# SCR_Spice-Models
Just two Spices models for SCR, one for generic one and the other for a C106D


- The first order model comes from **M.  Rashid,  “Thyristors”  in _Power  Electronics  Devices,  Circuits,  and Applications_, fourth edition, Edinburgh Gate, Harlow, Inglaterra: PearsonEducation Limited, 2014. pp. 467 - 526**.

- The second order model was proposed by **F. Gracia, F. Arizti, y F. Aranceta, “A Nonideal Macromodel of Thyristorfor Transient Analysis in Power Electronic Systems”,IEEE Transactionson Industrial Electronics, vol. 37, No. 6, dec, 1990** and modified in order to follow the C106D characteristics.
